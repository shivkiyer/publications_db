abstract={Renewable energy sources like wind, sun, and hydro are seen as a reliable alternative to the traditional energy sources such as oil, natural gas, or coal. Distributed power generation systems (DPGSs) based on renewable energy sources experience a large development worldwide, with Germany, Denmark, Japan, and USA as leaders in the development in this field. Due to the increasing number of DPGSs connected to the utility network, new and stricter standards in respect to power quality, safe running, and islanding protection are issued. As a consequence, the control of distributed generation systems should be improved to meet the requirements for grid interconnection. This paper gives an overview of the structures for the DPGS based on fuel cell, photovoltaic, and wind turbines. In addition, control structures of the grid-side converter are presented, and the possibility of compensation for low-order harmonics is also discussed. Moreover, control strategies when running on grid faults are treated. This paper ends up with an overview of synchronization methods and a discussion about their importance in the control},

title={Adaptive Decentralized Droop Controller to Preserve Power Sharing Stability of Paralleled Inverters in Distributed Generation Microgrids}, 
year={2008}, 
volume={23}, 
number={6}, 
pages={2806-2816}, 
abstract={This paper addresses the low-frequency relative stability problem in paralleled inverter-based distributed generation (DG) units in microgrids. In the sense of the small-signal dynamics of a microgrid, it can be shown that as the demanded power of each inverter changes, the low-frequency modes of the power sharing dynamics drift to new locations and the relative stability is remarkably affected, and eventually, instability can be yielded. To preserve the power sharing stability, an adaptive decentralized droop controller of paralleled inverter-based DG units is presented in this paper. The proposed power sharing strategy is based on the static droop characteristics combined with an adaptive transient droop function. Unlike conventional droop controllers, which yield 1-DOF tunable controller, the proposed droop controller yields 2-DOF tunable controller. Subsequently, the dynamic performance of the power sharing mechanism can be adjusted, without affecting the static droop gain, to damp the oscillatory modes of the power sharing controller. To account for the power modes immigration at different loading conditions, the transient droop gains are adaptively scheduled via small-signal analysis of the power sharing mechanism along the loading trajectory of each DG unit to yield the desired transient and steady-state response. The gain adaptation scheme utilizes the filtered active and reactive powers as indices; therefore, a stable and smooth power injection performance can be obtained at different loading conditions. The adaptive nature of the proposed controller ensures active damping of power oscillations at different operating conditions, and yields a stable and robust performance of the paralleled inverter system.},

abstract={The enabling of ac microgrids in distribution networks allows delivering distributed power and providing grid support services during regular operation of the grid, as well as powering isolated islands in case of faults and contingencies, thus increasing the performance and reliability of the electrical system. The high penetration of distributed generators, linked to the grid through highly controllable power processors based on power electronics, together with the incorporation of electrical energy storage systems, communication technologies, and controllable loads, opens new horizons to the effective expansion of microgrid applications integrated into electrical power systems. This paper carries out an overview about microgrid structures and control techniques at different hierarchical levels. At the power converter level, a detailed analysis of the main operation modes and control structures for power converters belonging to microgrids is carried out, focusing mainly on grid-forming, grid-feeding, and grid-supporting configurations. This analysis is extended as well toward the hierarchical control scheme of microgrids, which, based on the primary, secondary, and tertiary control layer division, is devoted to minimize the operation cost, coordinating support services, meanwhile maximizing the reliability and the controllability of microgrids. Finally, the main grid services that microgrids can offer to the main network, as well as the future trends in the development of their operation and control for the next future, are presented and discussed.},

abstract={The increasing penetration of distributed power generation into the power system leads to a continuous evolution of grid interconnection requirements. In particular, active power control will play an important role both during grid faults (low-voltage ride-through capability and controlled current injection) and in normal conditions (reserve function and frequency regulation). The aim of this paper is to propose a flexible active power control based on a fast current controller and a reconfigurable reference current selector. Several strategies to select the current reference are studied and compared using experimental results that are obtained during an unsymmetrical voltage fault. The results of the analysis allow selection of the best reference current in every condition. The proposed methods facilitate multiple choices for fault ride through by simply changing the reference selection criteria.},

abstract={The steady growth of installed wind power together with the upscaling of the single wind turbine power capability has pushed the research and development of power converters toward full-scale power conversion, lowered cost pr kW, increased power density, and also the need for higher reliability. In this paper, power converter technologies are reviewed with focus on existing ones and on those that have potential for higher power but which have not been yet adopted due to the important risk associated with the high-power industry. The power converters are classified into single- and multicell topologies, in the latter case with attention to series connection and parallel connection either electrical or magnetic ones (multiphase/windings machines/transformers). It is concluded that as the power level increases in wind turbines, medium-voltage power converters will be a dominant power converter configuration, but continuously cost and reliability are important issues to be addressed.},

abstract={Voltage-oriented PI control of three-phase grid-connected pulsewidth-modulation rectifiers with LCL filters is addressed. LCL filters require resonance damping. Active resonance damping is state of the art to face the problem, but it is still under investigation because of the manifold solutions. It is often realized using many sensors and/or complex control algorithms. In contrast, pure PI control requires only one set of current sensors, and its implementation and design are rather simple and well known from the L filter control. PI control has already been shown to be a suitable solution also for LCL filters, but there are limitations. These are investigated in this paper. System stability is analyzed with respect to different ratios of LCL filter resonance and control frequencies. The latter are important parameters for system design and control. Both line and converter current control are analyzed. For a certain range of frequency ratios, the voltage-oriented PI control gives stable performance without additional feedback, but for ratios outside this range, stable operation is impossible. Experimental tests validate the theoretical results. In addition, an experimentally determined LCL filter transfer function is shown in this paper, which shows a lower resonance peak as expected from commonly used filter models.},

It will be shown that a grid-connected inverter will remain stable if the ratio between the grid impedance and the inverter output impedance satisfies the Nyquist stability criterion.

Versatile power transfer was defined as multimodes of operation, including normal operation without use of battery, power dispatching, and power averaging, which enables grid- or user-friendly operation. A supervisory control regulates power generation of the individual components so as to enable the hybrid system to operate in the proposed modes of operation. The concept and principle of the hybrid system and its control were described. A simple technique using a low-pass filter was introduced for power averaging. A modified hysteresis-control strategy was applied in the battery converter. Modeling and simulations were based on an electromagnetic-transient-analysis program.

The selected switching technique to control the inverter will also have an effective role on harmonic elimination while generating the ideal output voltage. Intensive studies have been performed on carrier-based, sinusoidal, space vector and sigma delta \{PWM\} methods in open loop control of inverters.

Filter capacitor current, as well as voltage feedback for the purpose of resonance damping, are analyzed and compared. Basic studies in the continuous Laplace domain show that either proportional current feedback or derivative voltage feedback yields resonance damping. Detailed investigations of these two approaches in the discrete z-domain, taking into account the discrete nature of control implementation, sampling, and PWM, are carried out. Several ratios of LCL resonance frequency and control frequency are considered. At high resonance frequencies, only current feedback stabilizes the system. At medium resonance frequencies, both approaches have good performance. At low resonance frequencies, stability gets worse, even though voltage feedback offers slightly better damping properties.

abstract={The use of an inverter with an output LC filter allows for generation of output sinusoidal voltages with low harmonic distortion, suitable for uninterruptible power supply systems. However, the controller design becomes more difficult. This paper presents a new and simple control scheme using predictive control for a two-level converter. The controller uses the model of the system to predict, on each sampling interval, the behavior of the output voltage for each possible switching state. Then, a cost function is used as a criterion for selecting the switching state that will be applied during the next sampling interval. In addition, an observer is used for load-current estimation, enhancing the behavior of the proposed controller without increasing the number of current sensors. Experimental results under linear and nonlinear load conditions, with a 5.5-kW prototype, are presented, verifying the feasibility and good performance of the proposed control scheme.},

abstract={For a grid-connected converter with an LCL filter, the harmonic compensators of a proportional-resonant (PR) controller are usually limited to several low-order current harmonics due to system instability when the compensated frequency is out of the bandwidth of the system control loop. In this paper, a new current feedback method for PR current control is proposed. The weighted average value of the currents flowing through the two inductors of the LCL filter is used as the feedback to the current PR regulator. Consequently, the control system with the LCL filter is degraded from a third-order function to a first-order one. A large proportional control-loop gain can be chosen to obtain a wide control-loop bandwidth, and the system can be optimized easily for minimum current harmonic distortions, as well as system stability. The inverter system with the proposed controller is investigated and compared with those using traditional control methods. Experimental results on a 5-kW fuel-cell inverter are provided, and the new current control strategy has been verified.},

abstract={Renewable energy resources (RES) are being increasingly connected in distribution systems utilizing power electronic converters. This paper presents a novel control strategy for achieving maximum benefits from these grid-interfacing inverters when installed in 3-phase 4-wire distribution systems. The inverter is controlled to perform as a multi-function device by incorporating active power filter functionality. The inverter can thus be utilized as: 1) power converter to inject power generated from RES to the grid, and 2) shunt APF to compensate current unbalance, load current harmonics, load reactive power demand and load neutral current. All of these functions may be accomplished either individually or simultaneously. With such a control, the combination of grid-interfacing inverter and the 3-phase 4-wire linear/non-linear unbalanced load at point of common coupling appears as balanced linear load to the grid. This new control concept is demonstrated with extensive MATLAB/Simulink simulation studies and validated through digital signal processor-based laboratory experimental results.},

abstract={Wind power is still the most promising renewable energy in the year of 2013. The wind turbine system (WTS) started with a few tens of kilowatt power in the 1980s. Now, multimegawatt wind turbines are widely installed even up to 6-8 MW. There is a widespread use of wind turbines in the distribution networks and more and more wind power stations, acting as power plants, are connected directly to the transmission networks. As the grid penetration and power level of the wind turbines increase steadily, the wind power starts to have significant impacts to the power grid system. Therefore, more advanced generators, power electronic systems, and control solutions have to be introduced to improve the characteristics of the wind power plant and make it more suitable to be integrated into the power grid. Meanwhile, there are also some emerging technology challenges, which need to be further clarified and investigated. This paper gives an overview and discusses some development trends in the technologies used for wind power systems. First, the developments of technology and market are generally discussed. Next, several state-of-the-art wind turbine concepts, as well as the corresponding power electronic converters and control structures, are reviewed, respectively. Furthermore, grid requirements and the technology challenges for the future WTS are also addressed.},

abstract={Pulsewidth modulation (PWM) voltage source converters are becoming a popular interface to the power grid for many applications. Hence, issues related to the reduction of PWM harmonics injection in the power grid are becoming more relevant. The use of high-order filters like LCL filters is a standard solution to provide the proper attenuation of PWM carrier and sideband voltage harmonics. However, those grid filters introduce potentially unstable dynamics that should be properly damped either passively or actively. The second solution suffers from control and system complexity (a high number of sensors and a high-order controller), even if it is more attractive due to the absence of losses in the damping resistors and due to its flexibility. An interesting and straightforward active damping solution consists in plugging in, in cascade to the main controller, a filter that should damp the unstable dynamics. No more sensors are needed, but there are open issues such as preserving the bandwidth, robustness, and limited complexity. This paper provides a systematic approach to the design of filter-based active damping methods. The tuning procedures, performance, robustness, and limitations of the different solutions are discussed with theoretical analysis, selected simulation, and experimental results.},

abstract={This paper proposes a hybrid fuel cell power system, which consists of a fuel cell, an isolated unidirectional converter, a bidirectional converter, an inverter, and a battery. The fuel cell and the battery are connected to the same voltage bus through an appropriate hybrid full-bridge LLC resonant unidirectional converter and a three-level buck/boost bidirectional converter, respectively. The battery is an auxiliary energy source, powers the load during the system's start state to make it easy for the system to cold start, and provides or absorbs the dynamic power when the load varies and the fuel cell cannot respond immediately, so the system dynamic characteristics are improved. Furthermore, the battery can also provide peak power at overload, so the power rating of the fuel cell can be decreased, which reduces the total system cost. In order to ensure that the system operates with high efficiency, this paper also proposes a power management control scheme, which controls the bidirectional converter operating under buck, boost, or shutdown mode according to the operation condition of the fuel cell and battery, so that the battery can be charged or discharged. The operation of the system during cold start and overload are analyzed in detail. A 1-kW fuel cell power system was built in the laboratory. Experimental results are shown to verify the theoretical analysis.},

abstract={Low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) requirements demand wind-power plants to remain connected to the network in presence of grid-voltage dips. Most dips present positive-, negative-, and zero-sequence components. Hence, regulators based on symmetrical components are well suited to control grid-connected converters. A neutral-point-clamped topology has been considered as an active front end of a distributed power-generation system, following the trend of increasing power and voltage levels in wind-power systems. Three different current controllers based on symmetrical components and linear quadratic regulator have been considered. The performance of each controller is evaluated on LVRT requirement fulfillment, grid-current balancing, maximum grid-current value control, and oscillating power flow. Simulation and experimental results show that all three controllers meet LVRT requirements, although different system performance is found for each control approach. Therefore, controller selection depends on the system constraints and the type of preferred performance features.},

The dc microgrid consists of a wind turbine, a battery energy storage system, dc loads, and a grid-connected converter system. When the system is grid connected, active power is balanced through the grid supply during normal operation to ensure a constant dc voltage. Automatic power balancing during a grid ac fault is achieved by coordinating the battery energy storage system and the grid converter. To ensure that the system can operate under island conditions, a coordinated strategy for the battery system, wind turbine, and load management, including load shedding, are proposed.

abstract={This paper proposes predictive direct power control (P-DPC), a new control approach where the well-known direct power control is combined with predictive selection of a voltage-vectors' sequence, obtaining both high transient dynamics and a constant-switching frequency. The developed P-DPC version is based on an optimal application of three voltage vectors in a symmetrical way, which is the so-called symmetrical 3 + 3 vectors' sequence. The simulation and experimental results of the P-DPC are compared to standard voltage-oriented control (VOC) strategies in a grid-connected three-phase voltage-source inverter under 400-V 15-kVA operation conditions. The P-DPC improves the transient response and keeps the steady-state harmonic spectrum at the same level as the VOC strategies. Due to its high transient capability and its constant-switching behavior, the P-DPC could become an interesting alternative to standard VOC techniques for grid-connected converters},

abstract={The increased penetration of nonlinear loads and power-electronics-based distributed generation (DG) systems may introduce power quality issues to the distribution power system. However, if controlled and regulated properly, the DG-grid interfacing converters are able to improve the distribution system efficiency and power quality. This paper focuses on the distribution system harmonic control through the DG-grid interfacing converters. Two alternative DG systems, namely, current-controlled DG and voltage-controlled DG, are considered. While most of the previous works on harmonic compensation are based on the current-controlled method, a novel harmonic control scheme using a voltage-controlled method is developed in this paper. The voltage-controlled method is more flexible and has similar compensation performance compared to the conventional current-controlled method. In addition, by avoiding the implementation of a harmonic current tracking loop, the proposed voltage-based method can be seamlessly incorporated into a voltage-controlled DG unit, which is important to provide direct voltage and frequency support in a microgrid. Moreover, the possible harmonic circulating current among multiple DG systems is also investigated in this paper. Simulations and experimental results from a three-phase 5-kVA laboratory DG prototype are provided to validate the discussion.},

abstract={This paper analyzes the stability problem of the grid-connected voltage-source inverter (VSI) with LC filters, which demonstrates that the possible grid-impedance variations have a significant influence on the system stability when conventional proportional-integrator (PI) controller is used for grid current control. As the grid inductive impedance increases, the low-frequency gain and bandwidth of the PI controller have to be decreased to keep the system stable, thus degrading the tracking performance and disturbance rejection capability. To deal with this stability problem, an H‚àû controller with explicit robustness in terms of grid-impedance variations is proposed to incorporate the desired tracking performance and the stability margin. By properly selecting the weighting functions, the synthesized H‚àû controller exhibits high gains at the vicinity of the line frequency, similar to the traditional proportional-resonant controller; meanwhile, it has enough high-frequency attenuation to keep the control loop stable. An inner inverter-output-current loop with high bandwidth is also designed to get better disturbance rejection capability. The selection of weighting functions, inner inverter-output-current loop design, and system disturbance rejection capability are discussed in detail in this paper. Both simulation and experimental results of the proposed H‚àû controller as well as the conventional PI controller are given and compared, which validates the performance of the proposed control scheme.},

abstract={Power electronic converters are commonly used for interfacing distributed generation (DG) systems to the electrical power network. This paper deals with a single-phase inverter for DG systems requiring power quality features, such as harmonic and reactive power compensation for grid-connected operation. The idea is to integrate the DG unit functions with shunt active power filter capabilities. With this approach, the inverter controls the active power flow from the renewable energy source to the grid and also performs the nonlinear load current harmonic compensation by keeping the grid current almost sinusoidal. The control scheme employs a current reference generator based on sinusoidal signal integrator and instantaneous reactive power (IRP) theory together with a dedicated repetitive current controller. Experimental results obtained on a 4-kVA inverter prototype demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution.},

abstract={Space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM) has been widely applied in the current control of three-phase voltage source inverters (VSIs). However, for grid-connected VSIs in distributed generation (DG) systems, the performance of current controllers based on SVPWM is compromised by the grid harmonics and the control delay due to computation and sampling. In this paper, an advanced SVPWM-based predictive current controller is proposed and studied. The controller mimics deadbeat control in the synchronous d-q reference frame, and is very simple and robust to implement. With the necessary grid voltage detection in DG systems for protection, grid harmonics disturbance is effectively suppressed through feedforward compensation. Based on a dual-timer sampling scheme, the control delay compensation becomes more simple yet effective. The comprehensive analysis on the proposed predictive current control system is provided. The simulation and experimental test results show that the proposed current controller has an excellent steady-state response as well as an extremely fast dynamic response.},

The WECS adopts an AC-DC-AC converter system with voltage-source converters (VSC). The DC-link voltage command is determined according to output power fluctuations of the PMSG. The output power fluctuationsin low- and high-frequency domains are smoothed by the pitch angle control of the WECS, and the DC-link voltage control, respectively. By using the proposed method, the wind turbine blade stress is mitigated as the pitch action in high-frequency domain is reduced. In addition, the DC-link capacitor size is reduced without the charge/discharge action in low-frequency domain. A chopper circuit is used in the DC-link circuit for stable operation of the WECS under-line fault. Effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the numerical simulations.},

abstract={A higher order passive power filter (LLCL filter) for the grid-tied inverter is becoming attractive for industrial applications due to the possibility to reduce the cost of the copper and the magnetic material. However, similar to the conventional LCL filter, the grid-tied inverter is facing control challenges. An active or a passive damping measure can be adopted to suppress the possible resonances between the grid and the inverter. For an application with a stiff grid, a passive damping method is often preferred for its simpleness and low cost. This paper introduces a new passive damping scheme with low power loss for the LLCL filter. Also, a simple engineering design criterion is proposed to find the optimized damping resistor value, which is both effective for the LCL filter and the LLCL filter. The control analysis and the power loss comparison for different filter cases are given. All these are verified through the experiments on a 2-kW single-phase grid-tied inverter prototype using proportional resonant controllers. It is concluded that, compared with the LCL filter, the proposed passive damped LLCL filter can not only save the total filter inductance and reduce the volume of the filter but also reduce the damping power losses for a stiff grid application.},

abstract={A new, hybrid integrated topology, fed by photovoltaic (PV) and fuel cell (FC) sources and suitable for distributed generation applications, is proposed. It works as an uninterruptible power source that is able to feed a certain minimum amount of power into the grid under all conditions. PV is used as the primary source of power operating near maximum power point (MPP), with the FC section (block), acting as a current source, feeding only the deficit power. The unique "integrated" approach obviates the need for dedicated communication between the two sources for coordination and eliminates the use of a separate, conventional dc/dc boost converter stage required for PV power processing, resulting in a reduction of the number of devices, components, and sensors. Presence of the FC source in parallel (with the PV source) improves the quality of power fed into the grid by minimizing the voltage dips in the PV output. Another desirable feature is that even a small amount of PV power (e.g., during low insolation), can be fed into the grid. On the other hand, excess power is diverted for auxiliary functions like electrolysis, resulting in an optimal use of the energy sources. The other advantages of the proposed system include low cost, compact structure, and high reliability, which render the system suitable for modular assemblies and "plug-n-play" type applications. All the analytical, simulation, and experimental results of this research are presented.},

abstract={This paper addresses the resonance problem in a parallel-inverter-based grid-interactive microgrid. Unlike the single grid-connected inverter system where the resonance frequency is mainly fixed by the inverter output LCL filter parameters, the parallel-inverter-based grid-interactive microgrid system presents a more challenging picture where inverter interactions will excite complex resonances at various frequencies. As a result, line currents of inverters can be severely distorted even when the control schemes and filter circuits are properly designed based on the single-inverter model. This paper first develops a microgrid model using discrete time-domain closed-loop Norton's equivalent circuit. Multiple resonances can then be evaluated with the developed model. To improve the microgrid power quality, this paper also designs a virtual-harmonic-resistance-based active damping method. The proposed damping method can be seamlessly incorporated into the conventional deadbeat control scheme through the direct control reference modification. Therefore, the active damping method is able to address both the transient and steady-state resonances within the deadbeat current control bandwidth. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the correctness of the developed resonance modeling and active damping methods.},

abstract={Synchronization with the utility networks is crucial for operating three-phase grid-interfaced converters. A challenge of synchronization is how to fast and precisely extract the fundamental positive and negative sequences under the distorted and unbalanced conditions. Many phase-locked loop (PLL) and synchronization techniques have been presented in the past decades. Most of them make a tradeoff between the accuracy and dynamic response under severe distorted and unbalanced conditions. In this paper, a multiple-complex coefficient-filter-based PLL is presented, and its unique feature lies in the accurate and rapid extraction of the positive and negative sequence components from the polluted grid voltage, and the harmonic components can also be estimated precisely, which has the potential use for selective compensation in active filter applications. Another advantage of the proposed method is its flexibility for simplifying its structure in some specified conditions. Results of continuous-domain simulations in MATLAB and discrete-domain experiments based on a 32-b fixed-point TMS320F2812 DSP are in good agreement, which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.},
