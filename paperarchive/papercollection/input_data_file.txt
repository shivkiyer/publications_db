abstract={Microgrid-containing parallel-connected inverters, where each inverter is controlled by decentralized active power/voltage frequency and reactive power/voltage magnitude droop control laws results in flexible and expandable systems. These systems have been known to have stability problems for large values of active power/voltage frequency droop control gain. However, so far the stability analysis of multi-inverter systems has always been performed in a computationally intensive manner by considering the entire microgrid. In a practical microgrid, where the number of inverters may be large or the capacity of the units may differ, it becomes essential to develop a method by which stability can be examined without much computational burden. The system of differential algebraic equations has been simplified using justifiable assumptions to result in a final expression that allows the stability of the microgrid to be examined separately with respect to the droop control laws of each inverter transformed into an equivalent network. Moreover, the procedure allows taking into consideration the R/X ratio of the interconnecting cables. Analysis of final expressions validate the stability results reported in literature. Experimental results on hardware show the stable operation of the microgrid.},

A brief introduction of the need for shunt compensation as well as the requirements of the shunt compensator has also been given. An algorithm for generating references has been described. Three major topologies of inverters - three-leg inverter with single dc capacitor, three-leg inverter with neutral clamped dc capacitors, four-leg inverter and three single-phase inverters with common dc capacitor - have been described and simulated. \{DSTATCOM\} topologies for high voltage distribution systems have also been described. The Voltage Source Converter (VSC) topologies have been compared on the basis of the performance of the inverter for certain chosen system conditions and the number of switch devices and dc capacitors used.

abstract={Application of individual distributed generators can cause as many problems as it may solve. A better way to realize the emerging potential of distributed generation is to take a system approach which views generation and associated loads as a subsystem or a "microgrid". During disturbances, the generation and corresponding loads can separate from the distribution system to isolate the microgrid's load from the disturbance (providing UPS services) without harming the transmission grid's integrity. This ability to island generation and loads together has a potential to provide a higher local reliability than that provided by the power system as a whole. In this model it is also critical to be able to use the waste heat by placing the sources near the heat load. This implies that a unit can be placed at any point on the electrical system as required by the location of the heat load.},

abstract={In this paper, a new control method for the parallel operation of inverters operating in an island grid or connected to an infinite bus is described. Frequency and voltage control, including mitigation of voltage harmonics, are achieved without the need for any common control circuitry or communication between inverters. Each inverter supplies a current that is the result of the voltage difference between a reference ac voltage source and the grid voltage across a virtual complex impedance. The reference ac voltage source is synchronized with the grid, with a phase shift, depending on the difference between rated and actual grid frequency. A detailed analysis shows that this approach has a superior behavior compared to existing methods, regarding the mitigation of voltage harmonics, short-circuit behavior and the effectiveness of the frequency and voltage control, as it takes the R to X line impedance ratio into account. Experiments show the behavior of the method for an inverter feeding a highly nonlinear load and during the connection of two parallel inverters in operation.},

abstract={This paper deals with the design of the output impedance of uninterruptible power system (UPS) inverters with parallel-connection capability. In order to avoid the need for any communication among modules, the power-sharing control loops are based on the  droop method. Since in these systems the power-sharing accuracy is highly sensitive to the inverters output impedance, novel control loops to achieve both stable output impedance and proper power balance are proposed. In this sense, a novel wireless controller is designed by using three nested loops: 1) the inner loop is performed by using feedback linearization control techniques, providing a good quality output voltage waveform; 2) the intermediate loop enforces the output impedance of the inverter, achieving good harmonic power sharing while maintaining low output voltage total harmonic distortion; and 3) the outer loop calculates the output active and reactive powers and adjusts the output impedance value and the output voltage frequency during the load transients, obtaining excellent power sharing without deviations in either the frequency or the amplitude of the output voltage. Simulation and experimental results are reported from a parallel-connected UPS system sharing linear and nonlinear loads.},

abstract={The analysis of the small-signal stability of conventional power systems is well established, but for inverter based microgrids there is a need to establish how circuit and control features give rise to particular oscillatory modes and which of these have poor damping. This paper develops the modeling and analysis of autonomous operation of inverter-based microgrids. Each sub-module is modeled in state-space form and all are combined together on a common reference frame. The model captures the detail of the control loops of the inverter but not the switching action. Some inverter modes are found at relatively high frequency and so a full dynamic model of the network (rather than an algebraic impedance model) is used. The complete model is linearized around an operating point and the resulting system matrix is used to derive the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues (termed "modes") indicate the frequency and damping of oscillatory components in the transient response. A sensitivity analysis is also presented which helps identifying the origin of each of the modes and identify possible feedback signals for design of controllers to improve the system stability. With experience it is possible to simplify the model (reduce the order) if particular modes are not of interest as is the case with synchronous machine models. Experimental results from a microgrid of three 10-kW inverters are used to verify the results obtained from the model},

year={2008}, 
volume={23}, 
number={6}, 
pages={2806-2816}, 
abstract={This paper addresses the low-frequency relative stability problem in paralleled inverter-based distributed generation (DG) units in microgrids. In the sense of the small-signal dynamics of a microgrid, it can be shown that as the demanded power of each inverter changes, the low-frequency modes of the power sharing dynamics drift to new locations and the relative stability is remarkably affected, and eventually, instability can be yielded. To preserve the power sharing stability, an adaptive decentralized droop controller of paralleled inverter-based DG units is presented in this paper. The proposed power sharing strategy is based on the static droop characteristics combined with an adaptive transient droop function. Unlike conventional droop controllers, which yield 1-DOF tunable controller, the proposed droop controller yields 2-DOF tunable controller. Subsequently, the dynamic performance of the power sharing mechanism can be adjusted, without affecting the static droop gain, to damp the oscillatory modes of the power sharing controller. To account for the power modes immigration at different loading conditions, the transient droop gains are adaptively scheduled via small-signal analysis of the power sharing mechanism along the loading trajectory of each DG unit to yield the desired transient and steady-state response. The gain adaptation scheme utilizes the filtered active and reactive powers as indices; therefore, a stable and smooth power injection performance can be obtained at different loading conditions. The adaptive nature of the proposed controller ensures active damping of power oscillations at different operating conditions, and yields a stable and robust performance of the paralleled inverter system.},

abstract={In this paper, a modified deadbeat control scheme is proposed for 3-phase PWM inverter control such as uninterruptible power supply (UPS). The deadbeat controller, which is generally constructed with voltage and current controller in UPS, is used for fast transient response, but this might have an instability due to the same pole placement of the double controller. To solve this instability problem, separation of pole placement can be considered, and it is performed by the proposed deadbeat control scheme. In this paper, this control scheme is called the modified deadbeat, which produces a first-order exponential response during one input step. As the overall controller is constructed by deadbeat control, the response of the proposed control system is fast and the structure of the controller is simple. In addition, the disturbance observer with full-order state is constructed, which can cancel the disturbances by adding a feedforward compensating loop in the controller and hence it can compensate the disturbances caused by a sudden load change in the UPS system},

abstract={This paper proposes a new control scheme based on a two-layer control structure to improve both the transient and steady-state responses of a closed-loop regulated pulse-width-modulated (PWM) inverter for high-quality sinusoidal AC voltage regulation. The proposed two-layer controller consists of a tracking controller and a repetitive controller. Pole assignment with state feedback has been employed in designing the tracking controller for transient response improvement, and a repetitive control scheme was developed in synthesizing the repetitive controller for steady-state response improvement. A design procedure is given for synthesizing the repetitive controller for PWM inverters to minimize periodic errors induced by rectifier-type nonlinear loads. The proposed control scheme has been realized using a single-chip digital signal processor (DSP) TMS320C14 from Texas Instruments. A 2-kVA PWM inverter has been constructed to verify the proposed control scheme.

abstract={Four control topologies for single-phase uninterruptible power system (UPS) inverters are presented and compared, with the common objective of providing a dynamically stiff, low total harmonic distortion (THD), sinusoidal output voltage. Full-state feedback, full-state command controllers are shown, utilizing both filter inductor current and filter capacitor current feedback to augment output voltage control. All controllers presented include output voltage decoupling in a manner analogous to “back EMF” decoupling in DC motor drives. Disturbance input decoupling of the load current and its derivative is presented. An observer-based controller is additionally considered and is shown to be a technically viable, economically attractive option. The accuracy transfer function of the observer estimate is used to evaluate its measurement performance. Comparative disturbance rejection is evaluated by overlaying the dynamic stiffness (inverse of output impedance) frequency response of each controller on a single plot. Experimental results for one controller are presented},

abstract={Many facilities, such as patient health care centers, data processing systems, and critical telecommunication links, rely on uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) to maintain a continuous supply of power in case of a line outage. In addition to requiring continuous power, many critical nonlinear loads are sensitive to incoming line transients and input harmonic voltage distortion. Conventional UPS systems operate to protect against such disturbances using complex filtering schemes, often employing large passive components. This paper presents the advantages of using real time digital signal processing (DSP) control of UPS systems. A DSP controlled UPS inverter and harmonic conditioning system is described and the performance is verified on a 150 kVA system},

pages={864-872}, 
abstract={In order to achieve the reduction of voltage distortion in AC power supplies (ACPSs), this paper describes an implementation of synchronous-frame control for selected frequencies in the output voltage. The regulation of the fundamental output voltage, as well as that of some low-order harmonics, is achieved using a synchronous-frame controller for each selected frequency in addition to a conventional control. The conventional part conserves good dynamic performance under load changes, while rotating-frame controllers allow a slow, but very precise compensation of the residual errors within the assumption that the harmonics produced by distorting load are slowly varying. Moreover, motivated by a fixed-point implementation, a set of refinements and modifications of the original scheme is proposed, allowing a reduction of signal processing requirements and a new control algorithm structure less sensitive to quantization and rounding errors. This solution is particularly effective for high-power fully digitally controlled ACPSs, where the voltage loop bandwidth is usually not large enough to provide regulation at harmonic frequencies. The proposed control scheme has been implemented using a fixed-point single-chip digital signal processor (ADMC401 by Analog Devices). Experimental results on a 3-kVA three-phase converter prototype show the effectiveness of the proposed approach},

abstract={This paper presents a state space approach to the problem of controlling a single phase PWM inverter with an LC output filter. These types of inverter are often used in uninterruptable power supplies (UPS) where a sine wave output voltage is to be maintained. Output voltage control is structured around an inner filter capacitor current loop where capacitor current is sensed via a single, small current transformer. This avoids the expense of multiple, active current sensors found in alternative designs. Performance of the capacitor current loop is enhanced with active decoupling of both the DC bus and the equivalent “back-EMF” of the output voltage. The output dynamic stiffness of the system is analyzed and plotted. Experimental results yield less than 0.5% total harmonic distortion (THD) at full load (8 kW), with transient response times of less than 200 μs},

abstract={This paper presents the analysis and design of a multiple feedback loop control scheme for single-phase voltage-source uninterruptible power supply (UPS) inverters with an L-C filter. The control scheme is based on sensing the current in the capacitor of the load filter and using it in an inner feedback loop. An outer voltage feedback loop is also incorporated to ensure that the load voltage is sinusoidal and well regulated. A general state-space averaged model of the UPS system is first derived and used to establish the steady-steady quiescent point. A linearized small signal dynamic model is then developed from the system general model using perturbation and small-signal approximation. The linearized system model is employed to examine the incremental dynamics of the power circuit and select appropriate feedback variables for stable operation of the closed-loop UPS system. Experimental verification of a laboratory model of the UPS system under the proposed closed-loop operation is provided for both linear and nonlinear loads. It is shown that the control scheme offers improved performance measures over existing schemes, It is simple to implement and capable of producing nearly perfect sinusoidal load voltage waveform at moderate switching frequency and reasonable size of filter parameters. Furthermore, the scheme has excellent dynamic response and high voltage utilization of the DC source},

abstract={Stationary frame proportional plus integral (PI) current-regulated voltage-source inverters are conventionally regarded as unsatisfactory for AC systems because they cannot eliminate steady-state errors. This paper presents a technique for interpreting the stationary/rotating frame transformations as modulation processes in the Laplace domain, which move the control function from one part of the frequency spectrum to another. The technique is used to compare stationary and synchronous frame PI regulators on a common basis to better understand the advantages of a synchronous frame regulator. A new form of stationary frame resonant regulator is then derived which achieves zero steady-state error without requiring the complex transformations of a synchronous frame regulator. The performance of this new regulator is evaluated and found to be similar to that of the synchronous frame PI regulator},

A system suck as this should also be fault tolerant and include the capability for redundancy.

We have developed a control technique for operating two or more single phase inverter modules in parallel with no auxiliary interconnections. This technique uses frequency, fundamental voltage, and harmonic voltage droop to allow independent inverters to share the load in proportion to their capacities.
