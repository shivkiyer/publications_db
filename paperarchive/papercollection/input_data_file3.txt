abstract={The concept of microgrid hierarchical control is presented recently. In this paper, a hierarchical scheme is proposed which includes primary and secondary control levels. The primary level comprises distributed generators (DGs) local controllers. The local controllers mainly consist of power, voltage and current controllers, and virtual impedance control loop. The central secondary controller is designed to manage the compensation of voltage unbalance at the point of common coupling (PCC) in an islanded microgrid. Unbalance compensation is achieved by sending proper control signals to the DGs local controllers.

pages={1360-1368},
abstract={In some photovoltaic (PV) applications, it is possible to remove the transformer of a system in order to reduce losses, cost, and size. In transformerless systems, the PV module parasitic capacitance can introduce leakage currents in which the amplitude depends on the converter topology, on the pulsewidth modulation, and on the resonant circuit comprised by the system components. Based on the common-mode voltage model, modulation techniques are proposed to eliminate the leakage current in transformerless PV systems without requiring any modification on the converter and any additional hardware. The main drawback is that the proposed modulation technique for two-level inverters can only be used with 650-V dc link in the case of a 110-V (rms) grid phase voltage. Comparisons among the modulation techniques are discussed, and it is proven that the proposed modulation for two- and three-level inverters presents the best results. To validate the models used in the simulations, an experimental three-phase inverter is used.},

year={2014},
volume={29},
number={7},
pages={3414-3427},
abstract={This paper investigates the capacitor-current-feedback active damping for the digitally controlled LCL-type grid-connected inverter. It turns out that proportional feedback of the capacitor current is equivalent to virtual impedance connected in parallel with the filter capacitor due to the computation and pulse width modulation (PWM) delays. The LCL-filter resonance frequency is changed by this virtual impedance. If the actual resonance frequency is higher than one-sixth of the sampling frequency (fs/6), where the virtual impedance contains a negative resistor component, a pair of open-loop unstable poles will be generated. As a result, the LCL-type grid-connected inverter becomes much easier to be unstable if the resonance frequency is moved closer to fs/6 due to the variation of grid impedance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a capacitor-current-feedback active damping with reduced computation delay, which is achieved by shifting the capacitor current sampling instant towards the PWM reference update instant. With this method, the virtual impedance exhibits more like a resistor in a wider frequency range, and the open-loop unstable poles are removed; thus, high robustness against the grid-impedance variation is acquired. Experimental results from a 6-kW prototype confirm the theoretical expectations.},

volume={23},

pages={622-631},
abstract={A new, hybrid integrated topology, fed by photovoltaic (PV) and fuel cell (FC) sources and suitable for distributed generation applications, is proposed. It works as an uninterruptible power source that is able to feed a certain minimum amount of power into the grid under all conditions. PV is used as the primary source of power operating near maximum power point (MPP), with the FC section (block), acting as a current source, feeding only the deficit power. The unique "integrated" approach obviates the need for dedicated communication between the two sources for coordination and eliminates the use of a separate, conventional dc/dc boost converter stage required for PV power processing, resulting in a reduction of the number of devices, components, and sensors. Presence of the FC source in parallel (with the PV source) improves the quality of power fed into the grid by minimizing the voltage dips in the PV output. Another desirable feature is that even a small amount of PV power (e.g., during low insolation), can be fed into the grid. On the other hand, excess power is diverted for auxiliary functions like electrolysis, resulting in an optimal use of the energy sources. The other advantages of the proposed system include low cost, compact structure, and high reliability, which render the system suitable for modular assemblies and "plug-n-play" type applications. All the analytical, simulation, and experimental results of this research are presented.},

abstract={This paper introduces an approach for the real-time extraction of the frequency, phase angle, and symmetrical components of the grid signal, which is of great importance for many applications in power systems such as power quality and protection. The proposed method is based on the concept of the adaptive notch filter that provides a fast and accurate estimation of the symmetrical components in the presence of frequency and amplitude variations. In addition, the system offers a high degree of immunity and insensitivity to power system disturbances, harmonics, and other types of pollutions that exist in the grid signal. The simplicity of the structure makes the method suitable for both software and hardware implementations. Moreover, this very simple and very powerful tool can be used as a synchronization technique, which further simplifies the control issues currently challenging the integration of distributed energy technologies into the electricity grid. Mathematical derivations are presented to describe the principles of operation, and experimental results confirm the validity of the analytical work.},

As with an electrical machine, source and converter flux, which equal the integration of the respective source and converter voltage, are used to define active and reactive power flow. Optimization of the lookup table used in conventional DPC is outlined first so as to improve power control and reduce current distortion. Then, constant switching frequency DPC is developed where the required converter voltage vector within a fixed half switching period is calculated directly from the active and reactive power errors. Detailed angle compensation due to the finite sampling frequency and the use of an integral controller to further improve the power control accuracy are described. Both simulation and experimental results are used to compare conventional DPC and vector control, and to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control strategies during active and reactive power steps, and line inductance variations.},

abstract={In evaluating the energy-generation potential of a photovoltaic (PV) energy system, the system is usually assumed to work without interruptions over its entire life. PV energy systems are fairly reliable, but as any complex system, they may fail. In PV systems, the inverter is responsible for the majority of failures, and most inverter failures are blamed on the aluminum electrolytic capacitors typically used in the dc bus. This paper investigates the effects of common failure modes on the reliability of PV inverters and suggests a model framework for decomposing the inverter into subsystems for more detailed study. The challenges of statistical analysis based on small data sets are discussed, and simulations are performed to illustrate the proposed model using a simple decomposition into subsystems of the inverter used in the 342-kW PV system at the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center.},

pages={2744-2751},
abstract={This paper describes the connected photovoltaic (PV) power generation system's grid overvoltage protection function and summarizes the occurrence of the output power loss due to the grid voltage rise. Power injection from the PV system will raise the voltage at the power distribution line. A power conditioning subsystem (PCS) needs to regulate its output if the voltage becomes higher than the upper limit in order to avoid the overvoltage at the power grid. Thus, a PV system cannot generate electricity under the high grid voltage. There are 553 residential PV systems installed in Ota, Japan, for the demonstration research project of clustered PV systems. Measurement data of these 2.1-MW grid-connected PV systems are used for the analysis. Only the limited number of PV systems experienced a significant amount of output energy loss due to the high grid voltage in a particular day, whereas the other system's outputs also raise the grid voltage. The causes of this maldistribution of the output energy loss are the difference of the line impedance, the difference of the starting voltage of the PCS's grid overvoltage protection function, and the imbalance of the load in single-phase three-wire power distribution systems. The present control of the PCS successfully avoids the overvoltage on the grid but cannot share the loss.},

abstract = "The hypothesis of this paper is that in order to identify least cost solutions of the integration of fluctuating renewable energy sources into current or future 100% renewable energy supplies one has to take a Smart Energy Systems approach. This paper outline why and how to do so. Traditionally, significant focus is put on the electricity sector alone to solve the renewable energy integration puzzle. Smart grid research traditionally focuses on ICT, smart meters, electricity storage technologies, and local (electric) smart grids. In contrast, the Smart Energy System focuses on merging the electricity, heating and transport sectors, in combination with various intra-hour, hourly, daily, seasonal and biannual storage options, to create the flexibility necessary to integrate large penetrations of fluctuating renewable energy. However, in this paper we present the development and design of coherent Smart Energy Systems as an integrated part of achieving future 100% renewable energy and transport solutions. The transition from fossil fuels towards the integration of more and more renewable energy requires rethinking and redesigning the energy system both on the generation and consumption side. To enable this, the Smart Energy System must have a number of appropriate infrastructures for the different sectors of the energy system, which are smart electricity grids, smart thermal grids (district heating and cooling), smart gas grids and other fuel infrastructures. It enables fluctuating renewable energy (such as wind, solar, wave power and low value heat sources) to utilise new sources of flexibility such as solid, gaseous, and liquid fuel storage, thermal storage and heat pumps and battery electric vehicles. Smart Energy Systems also enable a more sustainable and feasible use of bioenergy than the current types allow. It can potentially pave the way to a bioenergy-free 100% renewable energy and transport system."

abstract={Control structures and strategies have a critical influence on a power electronic converter's behavior during disturbances. Most of the previous works in the field of pulsewidth modulation voltage-source converter (VSC) operation under unbalanced conditions propose dual vector controllers with dc bus voltage optimization strategies, which have been proven to be well adapted for rectifier applications. In this paper, two major contributions are made. On the one hand, a new optimized operation strategy based on exchanged power maximization is proposed for vector control structures, which permits the extension of optimized operation to other VSC applications (e.g., flexible alternating current transmission system and distributed generation interfaces). On the other hand, a scalar control structure is proposed based on resonant controllers, together with three adapted optimized operation strategies, namely: 1) dc bus voltage optimization; 2) power exchange maximization; and 3) a hybrid strategy (an intermediary mode between the other two strategies). Their main advantage is their simplicity and the lack of real-time symmetrical component extraction techniques. This scalar controller and the proposed optimized operation strategies are compared to conventional vector controllers. It is proven through experimental analysis that the proposed scalar controller offers very good performances with simpler structures and bigger flexibility in terms of operation modes.},

The proposed voltage and power sharing controllers provide high disturbance rejection performance against voltage disturbances and power angle swings, respectively.

System efficiency has an important role in order to harvest the maximum available renewable energy from dc or ac sources while providing power backup capability. A control strategy is proposed in off-grid islanded mode method based on the microgrid line-frequency control as agent of communication for energy control between the DPG modules. A critical case is where the ac load demand could be lower than the available power from the photovoltaic solar array, where the battery bank can be overcharged with unrecoverable damage consequences. The DPG voltage-forming module controls the battery charge algorithm with a frequency-generator function, and the DPG current source module controls its output current through a frequency-detection function. The physical installation between DPG modules is independent, since no additional communication wiring is needed between power modules, which represent another integration advantage within the microgrid-type application.},

abstract={This paper deals with a single-phase distributed generation (DG) system with active power filtering (APF) capability, devised for utility current harmonic compensation. The idea is to integrate the DG unit functions with shunt APF capabilities, because the DG is connected in parallel to the grid. With the proposed approach, control of the DG unit is performed by injecting into the grid a current with the same phase and frequency of the grid voltage and with an amplitude depending on the power available from renewable sources. On the other hand, load harmonic current compensation is performed by injecting into the alternating current system harmonic currents like those of the load but with an opposite phase, thus keeping the line current almost sinusoidal. Both detection of the grid voltage fundamental and computation of the load harmonic compensation current have been performed by two neural adaptive filters with the same structure, one in a configuration ldquonotchrdquo and the other in the complementary configuration ldquoband.rdquo The ldquonotchrdquo filter has been used to compute the compensation current by eliminating only the contribution of the fundamental of the load current, whereas the ldquobandrdquo configuration is able to extract the fundamental of the coupling point voltage. Furthermore, because the active power generation and the APF features require current control of components at different frequencies, respectively, a multiresonant current controller has been adopted. The methodology has been tested successfully both in numerical simulation and experimentally on a suitably devised test setup. The stability analysis of the proposed control approach has been performed in the discrete domain.},

title={Flexible Voltage Support Control for Three-Phase Distributed Generation Inverters Under Grid Fault},

volume={60},

pages={1429-1441},
abstract={Ancillary services for distributed generation (DG) systems become a challenging issue to smartly integrate renewable-energy sources into the grid. Voltage control is one of these ancillary services which can ride through and support the voltage under grid faults. Grid codes from the transmission system operators describe the behavior of the energy source, regulating voltage limits and reactive power injection to remain connected and support the grid under fault. On the basis that different kinds of voltage sags require different voltage support strategies, a flexible control scheme for three-phase grid-connected inverters is proposed. In three-phase balanced voltage sags, the inverter should inject reactive power in order to raise the voltage in all phases. In one- or two-phase faults, the main concern of the DG inverter is to equalize voltages by reducing the negative symmetric sequence and clear the phase jump. Due to system limitations, a balance between these two extreme policies is mandatory. Thus, over- and undervoltage can be avoided, and the proposed control scheme prevents disconnection while achieving the desired voltage support service. The main contribution of this work is the introduction of a control algorithm for reference current generation that provides flexible voltage support under grid faults. Two different voltage sags have been experimentally tested to illustrate the behavior of the proposed voltage support control scheme.},

abstract={In this paper, definition of the circulating currents of multiphase paralleled converters is first presented, and the circulating-current-generating mechanism is clearly explained. Thus, based on this definition, an averaged model of the circulating current is proposed. It is seen from this model that the circulating current consists of not only the zero-sequence but also the nonzero-sequence components. The governing differential equation also shows explicitly the relation between the circulating currents and the affecting factors such as different pulse width-modulation strategies. With this understanding, a simple coordinate control is then presented to reduce the circulating current. The phenomenon of the intrinsic circulating current is also explained. Furthermore, a prototype system is constructed, and the proposed control is implemented using TMS320F2812 DSP.

abstract={The power generation system with a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), which can be used as an autonomous power system after the loss of mains in a distributed generation network, is described. After the mains outage, a fixed frequency and an amplitude of the output voltage are obtained, despite the variable rotor speed. For this reason, it can be successfully applied in the variable-speed wind turbines, adjustable speed water plants, or diesel engines. Moreover, the stand-alone operation of DFIG is useful in a flywheel-based high-energy rotary uninterruptible power supply system. An output voltage is controlled directly by the synchronization of an actual voltage vector with the reference vector represented in a synchronously rotating polar frame. The rotor current angular speed is obtained as a result of vectorial phase-locked loop operation. Any sensors or estimators of the rotor speed or position are unnecessary. Both amplitude and angle control loops are linear. The use of stand-alone operation in grid-connected systems requires mains outage detection. Also, the grid voltage recovery requires a method of synchronization and soft connection of a generator to the grid. The proposed methods of output voltage control, synchronization, and detection of mains loss were tested in a laboratory system.},

abstract={This letter introduces a new adaptive notch filtering (ANF) approach as a powerful tool for synchronization of converter-interfaced distributed generation systems that can potentially stimulate much interest in the field and provide improvement solutions for both grid-connected and stand-alone (islanding operation) modes of micro-grids. The proposed technique is simple and offers a high degree of immunity and insensitivity to power system disturbances, harmonics and other types of pollution that exist in the grid signal. A modified structure of the ANF-based synchronization technique is capable of decomposing three-phase quantities into symmetrical components, extracting harmonics, tracking the frequency variations, and providing means for voltage regulation and reactive power control. A prominent advantage of the proposed scheme is that it does not require a phase-locked loop for the synchronization. In addition, this very simple and very powerful power signal processor will simplify the control issues currently challenging the integration of distributed energy technologies onto the electricity grid. All converter-interfaced equipment, such as flexible AC transmission systems, custom power controllers, and active power filters, will benefit from this technique. Theoretical analysis is presented and the performance of the method is evaluated through simulation.},

year={2010},
volume={25},

pages={3119-3127},
abstract={The grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter has the ability of attenuating the high-frequency current harmonics. However, the current distortion caused by harmonics in the grid voltage is difficult to be eliminated. Increasing the loop gain can reduce the current distortion, but this approach is compromised by the system stability requirement. Without increasing the loop gain, applying feedforward of the grid voltage can suppress the effect of grid voltage harmonics. This paper proposes the feedforward function of the grid voltage for the grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter. Specifically, the proposed feedforward function involves proportional, derivative, and second derivative of the grid voltage, and can be simplified according to the dominant harmonics in the grid voltage. The proposed feedforward scheme can effectively suppress the current distortion arising from the grid voltage harmonics, and the steady-state error of the injected current can be substantially reduced even if a conventional proportional and integral regulator is applied. A 6-kW experimental prototype has been tested to verify the effectiveness of the proposed feedforward scheme.},

In addition, to increase the system utilization, the three-phase neutral point clamped inverter can be designed to also provide functions of active filter using the p-q theory.

abstract={The injected grid current regulator and active damping of the LCL filter are essential to the control of LCL-type grid-connected inverters. Generally speaking, the current regulator guarantees the quality of the injected grid current, and the active damping suppresses the resonance peak caused by the LCL filter and makes it easier to stabilize the whole system. Based on the proportional-integral (PI) and proportional-resonant (PR) compensator together with capacitor-current-feedback active-damping which are widely used for their effectiveness and simple implementations, this paper proposes a simple step-by-step controller design method for the LCL-type grid-connected inverter. By carefully dealing with the interaction between the current regulator and active damping, the complete satisfactory regions of the controller parameters for meeting the system specifications are obtained, and from which the controller parameters can be easily picked out. Based on these satisfactory regions, it is more convenient and explicit to optimize the system performance. Besides, the insight of tuning the controller parameters from these satisfactory regions is also discussed. Simulation and experimental results verify the proposed step-by-step design method.},

abstract={The proper operation of grid-connected power electronics converters needs using a synchronization technique to estimate the phase of the grid voltage. The performance of this synchronization technique is related to the quality of the consumed or delivered electric power. The synchronous-reference-frame phase-locked loop (SRF-PLL) has been widely used due to its ease of operation and robust behavior. However, the estimated phase can have a considerable amount of unwanted ripple if the grid voltage disturbances are not properly rejected. The aim of this paper is to propose an adaptive SRF-PLL which strongly rejects these disturbances even if the fundamental frequency of the grid voltage varies. This is accomplished by using several adaptive infinite-impulse-response notch filters, implemented by means of an inherently stable Schur-lattice structure. This structure is perfectly suited to be programmed in fixed-point DSPs (i.e., it has high mapping precision, low roundoff accumulation, and suppression of quantization limit cycle oscillations). The proposed adaptive SRF-PLL has been tested by means of the TI TMS320F2812 DSP. The obtained experimental results show that the proposed synchronization method highly rejects the undesired harmonics even if the fundamental harmonic frequency of a highly polluted grid voltage abruptly varies.},

abstract={The utility grid challenge is to meet the current growing energy demand. One solution to this problem is to expand the role of microgrids that interact with the utility grid and operate independently in case of a limited availability during peak time or outage. This paper proposes, for urban areas, a building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) primarily for self-feeding of buildings equipped with PV array and storage. With an aim of elimination of multiple energy conversions, a DC network distribution is considered. The BIPV can supply a tertiary building at the same time as PV array may produce power through a hierarchical supervision able to exchange messages with the smart grid and metadata. The hierarchical control is designed as an interface to expand the system ability for advanced energy management control having regard to the grid availability and user's commands. It consists of four layers: human-machine interface, prediction, cost management, and operation. The operation layer, implemented in an experimental platform, takes into account the grid supply power limits and constrains the DC load. The experimental results validate the approach that may be a solution for the future smart grid communication between BIPV and utility grid.},

abstract={Inverters adopted in distributed power generation, active filter, and uninterruptible power supply are often connected to the grid through an inductance-capacitor-inductance (LCL) filter. The impedance of the LCL filter has a typical frequency characteristic with a resonance peak. Hence, the LCL filter has to be damped in order to avoid instability. However, the resonance of the LCL filter can be also excited in a controlled way in order to individuate the resonance frequency in the spectrum (using for example the fast Fourier transform). This paper proposes to use a controlled excitation in measuring the grid impedance, since this one influences also the resonance frequency.

abstract = "Distributed generation is emerging as a new technology for supplying the increasing demand for electricity. Microgrids are attracting a great deal of attention since they integrate distributed generation in the main grid reliably and cleanly. When designing the control system of a microgrid, several functions must be considered, such as the management of electrical and thermal energy, load management, synchronisation with the main grid, etc. Both companies and institutions have carried out research into the control of microgrids over recent years and many proposals can be found in the literature. Thus, the design of the control system of a microgrid is a complex task due to its multiple functions and the large number of proposed solutions. This paper presents a complete description of the main features of a microgrid and describes the characteristics of the control systems used. Details are provided of the control tasks involved and of the main types of controls proposed in the literature. In addition, this paper describes the controls used in existing microgrids all over the world and proposes future areas for research."

abstract={This paper presents several nonisolated semi-Z-source inverters for a single-phase photovoltaic (PV) system with low cost and doubly grounded features. These semi-Z-source inverters employ the Z-source/quasi-Z-source network and only two active switches to achieve the same output voltage as the traditional voltage-fed full-bridge inverter does. The two active switches of the semi-Z-source inverter are controlled complementarily. Different from the traditional single-phase Z-source/quasi-Z-source inverter, shoot-through zero state is not applicable to the semi-Z-source inverter. The input dc source and the output ac voltage of the semi-Z-source inverter share the same ground, thus leading to less leakage ground current advantages over other nondoubly grounded inverters, such as voltage-fed full-bridge inverter. This is a preferred feature for nonisolated grid-connected inverters, especially in PV application. A revised nonlinear sinusoid pulse width modulation method for a semi-Z-source inverter is also proposed. By using this method, desired duty cycle can be generated to output the sinusoidal voltage. Other dc-dc converters with similar voltage gain curve, which can also be used as a single-phase inverter, are also discussed and summarized. A single-phase semi-Z-source inverter prototype is built; experimental results are provided to verify and demonstrate the special features of the proposed circuit.},

abstract={In the last few years, restrictive grid codes have arisen to ensure the performance and stability of electrical networks, which experience a massive integration of renewable energy sources and distributed generation systems that are normally connected to the grid through electronic power converters. In these codes, the injection of positive- and negative-sequence current components becomes necessary for fulfilling, among others, the low-voltage ride-through requirements during balanced and unbalanced grid faults. However, the performance of classical dq current controllers, applied to power converters, under unbalanced grid-voltage conditions is highly deficient, due to the unavoidable appearance of current oscillations. This paper analyzes the performance of the double synchronous reference frame controller and improves its structure by adding a decoupling network for estimating and compensating the undesirable current oscillations. Experimental results will demonstrate the validity of the proposed decoupled DSRF controller.},

abstract={A novel three-level (3L) bidirectional converter (BDC) is proposed in this paper.

Hence, the proposed converter is very suitable for fuel-cell/battery hybrid power systems. In addition, the voltage stress on the switch of the proposed converter is only half of the voltage on the high-voltage side, so it is also suitable for high-voltage applications. The operation principle and the implementation of the control circuit are presented in detail. This paper also proposes a novel bidirectional soft-start control strategy for the BDC.

First, different types of common WECSs are classified according to their features and drive train types. The WECSs are compared on the basis of the volume, weight, cost, efficiency, system reliability and fault ride through capability. The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control, which aims to make the generator speed meet an optimum value to ensure the maximum energy yield, plays a key role in the variable speed WECSs. A comprehensive review and comparison of the four most popular MPPT control methods are carried out and improvements for each method are presented. Furthermore, the latest development of wind energy conversion technologies is introduced, such as the brushless doubly fed induction generator (BDFIG), the stator permanent magnet synchronous generators, the magnetic-geared generators, dual power flow WECS with the electrical variable transmission (EVT) machine, and direct grid-connected WECS. Finally, the future trends of the technologies are discussed."

abstract={The power quality of a three-phase photovoltaic (PV) inverter drastically deteriorates in the presence of grid faults with unbalanced voltages. A ripple in the injected power and an increase in the current harmonic distortion are the main noticeable adverse effects produced by this abnormal grid situation. Several grid-fault control schemes are nowadays available for operating under unbalanced grid voltage. These control schemes usually have extreme power quality characteristics. Some of them have been conceived to completely avoid power ripple during unbalanced voltage sags, but at an expense of high current harmonic distortion. With other schemes, the harmonic distortion is totally eliminated but at an expense of high ripple in the injected power. This paper further explores the performance of PV inverters under unbalanced voltage sags. It has three theoretical contributions: 1) a generalized control scheme, which includes the aforementioned grid-fault controllers as particular cases; 2) a control strategy based on the use of continuous values for the control parameters. This original approach gives adjustable power quality characteristics that cannot be achieved with the previous control schemes; 3) three different control algorithms for calculating the continuous values of the control parameters. These contributions are experimentally validated with a digital signal processor-based laboratory prototype.},

The parallel-connected inverter ensures active and reactive power flow from the grid with low-current total harmonic distortion even in the presence of nonlinear load. A p-q theory-based approach is used to find the reference current of the parallel-connected converter to ensure desired operating conditions at the grid terminal. The proposed current controller is simple to implement and gives superior performance over the conventional current controllers, such as rotating frame proportional-integral controller or stationary frame proportional resonant controller. The stability of the proposed controller is ensured by direct Lyapunov method. A new technique based on the spatial repetitive controller is also proposed to improve the performance of the current controller by estimating the grid and other periodic disturbances. Detailed experimental results are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed current control scheme along with the proposed nonlinear controller to control the active and reactive power flow in a single-phase microgrid under different operating conditions.},

Contrary to the well-known conventional PI-based control strategies in RRFs, the presented method provides practically decoupled axes with a superior disturbance rejection capability. Moreover, its implementation is relatively simple and does not impose excessive structural complexity compared to its conventional PI-based competitors. The method is applicable to both single- and three-phase systems and also to anisotropic three-phase systems, e.g., synchronous motors with different direct and quadrature impedances driven by VSCs.

The mathematical models of such generators enable us to analyze their response under generic conditions. However, their mathematical complexity does not contribute to simplifying the analysis of the system under transient conditions and hence does not help in finding straightforward solutions for enhancing their FRT. This paper presents a simplified model of the DFIG, which has been extracted from the classical fifth-order model, which can accurately estimate the behavior of the system while significantly reducing its complexity.

abstract={This paper proposes an improved model predictive direct power control (MPDPC) for a pulse width modulation (PWM) rectifier by using a duty cycle control. The conventional MPDPC achieves good steady-state performance and quick dynamic response by selecting the best voltage vector, which minimizes the errors between the reference power and the real power. However, due to the limited number of voltage vectors in a two-level converter, the sampling frequency has to be high to achieve satisfactory performance. This paper introduces the concept of a duty cycle control in the MPDPC by allocating a fraction of control period for a nonzero voltage vector and the rest time for a zero vector. The nonzero vector is selected by evaluating the effects of each nonzero vector and its duration is obtained based on the principle of power errors minimization. Simulation and experimental results prove that, compared to the conventional MPDPC, the proposed MPDPC with duty cycle achieves further steady-state performance improvement without affecting the dynamic response at a small cost of control complexity increase.},

An overview of model reference adaptive state feedback theory is presented aiming to give the reader the required background for the adaptive current control design.
